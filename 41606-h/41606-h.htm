<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The origin of meteoric astronomy, as a science,
dates from the memorable star-shower of 1833.
Soon after that brilliant display it was found that
similar phenomena had been witnessed, at nearly
regular intervals, in former times. This discovery
led at once to another no less important, viz.: that
the nebulous masses from which such showers are
derived revolve about the sun in paths intersecting
the earth's orbit. The theory that these meteor-clouds
are but the scattered fragments of disintegrated
comets was announced by several astronomers
in 1867:&mdash;a theory confirmed in a remarkable
manner by the shower of meteors from the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of Biela's comet on the 27th of November,
1872.</p>

<p>To gratify the interest awakened in the public
mind by the discoveries here named, is the main
design of the following work. Among the subjects
considered are, cometary astronomy; aerolites, with
the phenomena attending their fall; the most bril<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>liant
star-showers of all ages; and the origin of
comets, aerolites, and falling stars.</p>

<small>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<p>A descriptive treatise on <span class="smcap">Comets</span> and <span class="smcap">Meteors</span>
may properly be preceded by a brief general view
of the <i>planetary</i> system to which these bodies are
related, and by which their motions, in direction
and extent, are largely influenced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Solar System</span> consists of the sun, together
with the planets, comets, and meteors which revolve
around it as the centre of their motions. The sun
is the great controlling orb of this system, and the
source of light and heat to its various members.
Its magnitude is one million three hundred thousand
times greater than that of the earth, and it
contains more than seven hundred times as much
matter as all the planets put together.</p>

<p>Mercury is the nearest planet to the sun; its
mean distance being about 35,400,000 miles. Its
diameter is 3000 miles, and it completes its orbital
revolution in 88 days.</p>

<p>Venus, the next member of the system, is sometimes
our morning and sometimes our evening star.
Its magnitude is almost exactly the same as that of
the earth. It revolves round the sun in 225 days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The earth is the third planet from the sun in
the order of distance; the radius of its orbit being
about 92,000,000 miles. It is attended by one satellite,&mdash;the
moon,&mdash;the diameter of which is 2160
miles.</p>

<p>Mars is the first planet exterior to the earth's
orbit. It is considerably smaller than the earth,
and has no satellite. It revolves round the sun in
687 days.</p>

<p><i>The Asteroids.</i>&mdash;Since the commencement of the
present century a remarkable zone of telescopic
planets has been discovered immediately exterior to
the orbit of Mars. These bodies are extremely
small; some of them probably containing less matter
than the largest mountains on the earth's surface.
131 members of the group are known at
present, and the number is annually increasing.</p>

<p>Jupiter, the first planet exterior to the asteroids,
is nearly 500,000,000 miles from the sun, and revolves
round it in a little less than 12 years. This
planet is 86,000 miles in diameter, and contains
more than twice as much matter as all the other
planets, primary and secondary, put together. Jupiter
is attended by four moons or satellites.</p>

<p>Saturn is the sixth of the principal planets in the
order of distance. Its orbit is about 400,000,000
miles beyond that of Jupiter. This planet is attended
by eight satellites, and is surrounded by
three broad flat rings. Saturn is 73,000 miles in
diameter, and its mass or quantity of matter is more
than that of all the other planets except Jupiter.</p>

<p>Uranus is at double the distance of Saturn, or
nineteen times that of the earth. Its diameter is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
about 34,000 miles, and its period of revolution 84
years. It is attended by at least four satellites.</p>

<p>Neptune is the most remote known member of
the system; its distance being 2,800,000,000 miles.
It is somewhat larger than Uranus; has certainly
one satellite, and probably several more. Its period
is about 165 years. A cannon-ball flying outward
from the sun at the uniform velocity of 500 miles
per hour would not reach the orbit of Neptune in
less than 639 years.</p>

<p>These planets all move round the sun in the same
direction,&mdash;from west to east. Their motions are
nearly circular, and also nearly in the same plane.
Their orbits, except that of Neptune, are represented
in the frontispiece. It is proper to remark,
however, that all representations of the solar system
by maps and planetariums must give an exceedingly
erroneous view either of the magnitudes or distances
of its various members. If the earth, for
instance, be denoted by a ball half an inch in diameter,
the diameter of the sun, according to the
same scale (16,000 miles to the inch), will be between
four and five feet; that of the earth's orbit, about
1000 feet; while that of Neptune's orbit will be
nearly six miles. To give an accurate representation
of the solar system at a single view is therefore
plainly impracticable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Zodiacal Light.</span>&mdash;This term was first applied
by Dominic Cassini, in 1683, to a faint nebulous
aurora, somewhat resembling the milky way, apparently
of a conical or lenticular form, having its
base toward the sun and its axis nearly in the direction
of the ecliptic. The most favorable time for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
observing it is when its axis is most nearly perpendicular
to the horizon. This, in our latitudes, occurs
in March, for the evening, and in October, for
the morning. The angular distance of its vertex
from the sun is frequently seventy or eighty degrees,
while sometimes, though rarely (except within
the tropics), it exceeds even one hundred degrees.
It was noticed in the latter part of the 16th century
by Tycho Brahe. The first accurate description of
the phenomenon was given, however, by Cassini.
This astronomer supposed the appearance to be produced
by the blended light of innumerable bodies
too small to be separately observed,&mdash;a theory still
very generally accepted. In other words, the zodiacal
light is probably a swarm of infinitesimal
planets; the greater part of the cluster being interior
to Mercury's orbit.</p>

<p>The distances between the different members of
our planetary system, vast as they may seem, sink
into insignificance when compared with the intervals
which separate us from the so-called fixed stars.
<i>Alpha Centauri</i>, the nearest of those twinkling luminaries,
is 7000 times more distant than Neptune
from the sun. Even light itself, which moves
185,000 miles in a second, is more than three years
in traversing the mighty interval.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>COMETS.</small></h3>


<p>The term <i>comet</i>&mdash;which signifies literally a <i>hairy
star</i>&mdash;may be applied to all bodies that revolve about
the sun in very eccentric orbits. The sudden appearance,
vast dimensions, and extraordinary aspect
of these celestial wanderers, together with their rapid
and continually varying motions, have never failed
to excite the attention and wonder of all observers.
Nor is it surprising that in former times, when the
nature of their orbits was wholly unknown, they
should have been looked upon as omens of impending
evil, or messengers of an angry Deity. Even
now, although modern science has reduced their
motions to the domain of law, determined approximately
their orbits, and assigned in a number of
instances their periods, the interest awakened by
their appearance is in some respects still unabated.</p>

<p>The special points of dissimilarity between planets
and comets are the following:&mdash;The former are
dense, and, so far as we know, solid bodies; the
latter are many thousand times rarer than the earth's
atmosphere. The planets <i>all</i> move from west to
east; many comets revolve in the opposite direction.
The planetary orbits are but slightly inclined to the
plane of the ecliptic; those of comets may have any
inclination whatever. The planets are observed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
all parts of their orbits; comets, only in those parts
nearest the sun.</p>

<p>The larger comets are attended by a <i>tail</i>, or train
of varying dimensions, extending generally in a
direction opposite to that of the sun. The more
condensed part, from which the tail proceeds, is
called the <i>nucleus</i>; and the nebulous envelope immediately
surrounding the nucleus is sometimes termed
the <i>coma</i>. These different parts are seen in Fig. 2,
which represents the great comet of 1811.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>Page 11.</p>
</div>

<p>Zeno, Democritus, and other Greek philosophers
held that comets were produced by the collection of
several stars into clusters. Aristotle taught that
they were formed by exhalations, which, rising from
the earth's surface, ignited in the upper regions of
the atmosphere. This hypothesis, through the great
influence of its author, was generally received for
almost two thousand years. Juster views, however,
were entertained by the celebrated Seneca, who
maintained that comets ought to be ranked among
the permanent works of nature, and that their disappearance
was not an extinction, but simply a
passing beyond the reach of our vision. The observations
of Tycho Brahe first established the fact
that comets move through the planetary spaces far
beyond the limits of our atmosphere. The illustrious
Dane, however, supposed them to move in circular
orbits. Kepler, on the other hand, was no less in
error in considering their paths to be rectilinear.
James Bernoulli supposed comets to be the satellites
of a very remote planet, invisible on account
of its great distance,&mdash;such satellites being seen only
in the parts of their orbits nearest the earth. Still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
more extravagant was the hypothesis of Descartes,
who held that they were originally fixed stars, which,
having gradually lost their light, could no longer
retain their positions, but were involved in the vortices
of the neighboring stars, when such as were
thus brought within the sphere of the sun's illuminating
power again became visible.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Comets visible in the daytime.</i></p>

<p>Comets of extraordinary brilliancy have sometimes
been seen during the daytime. At least
thirteen authentic instances of this phenomenon
have been recorded in history. The first was the
comet which appeared about the year 43 <small>B.C.</small>, just
after the assassination of Julius C&aelig;sar. The Romans
called it the <i>Julium Sidus</i>, and regarded it as a celestial
chariot sent to convey the soul of C&aelig;sar to the
skies. It was seen two or three hours before sunset,
and continued visible for eight successive days. The
great comet of 1106, described as an object of terrific
splendor, was seen simultaneously with the sun,
and in close proximity to it. Dr. Halley supposed
this and the Julian comet to have been previous
visits of the great comet of 1680. In the year 1402
two comets appeared,&mdash;one about the middle of
February, the other in June,&mdash;both of which were
visible while the sun was above the horizon. One
was of such magnitude and brilliancy that the
nucleus and even the tail could be seen at midday.
The comet of 1472, one of the most splendid recorded
in history, was visible in full daylight, when
nearest the earth, on the 21st of January. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
comet, according to Laugier, moves very nearly in
the plane of the ecliptic, its inclination being less
than two degrees. Its least distance from our globe
was only 3,300,000 miles. The comet of 1532, supposed
by some to be identical with that of 1661, was
also visible in full sunshine. The apparent magnitude
of its nucleus was three times greater than that
of Jupiter. The comet of 1577 was seen with the
naked eye by Tycho Brahe before sunset. It was
by observations on this body that Aristotle's doctrine
in regard to the origin, nature, and distance
of comets was proved to be erroneous. It was
simultaneously observed by Tycho at Oranienberg,
and Thaddeus Hagecius at Prague; the points of
observation being more than 400 miles apart, and
nearly on the same meridian. The comet was found
to have no sensible diurnal parallax; in other words,
its apparent place in the heavens was the same to
each observer, which could not have been the case
had the comet been less distant than the moon. The
comet which passed its perihelion on the 8th of November,
1618, was distinctly seen by Marsilius when
the sun was above the horizon. The great comet
of 1744 was seen without the aid of a glass at one
o'clock in the afternoon,&mdash;only five hours after its
perihelion passage. The diameter of this body was
nearly equal to that of Jupiter. It had <i>six</i> tails, the
greatest length of which was about 30,000,000 miles,
or nearly one-third of the distance of the earth from
the sun. The spaces between the tails were as dark
as the rest of the heavens, while the tails themselves
were bordered with a luminous edging of great
beauty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The great comet of 1843 was distinctly visible to
the naked eye, at noon, on the 28th of February.
It appeared as a brilliant body, within less than two
degrees from the sun. This comet passed its perihelion
on the 27th of February, at which time its
distance from the sun's surface was only about one-fourth
of the moon's distance from the earth. This
is the nearest approach to the sun ever made by any
known comet. The velocity of the body in perihelion
was about 1,280,000 miles an hour, or nearly
nineteen times that of the earth in its orbit. The
apparent length of its tail was sixty-five degrees, and
its true length 150,000,000 miles. The first comet
of 1847, discovered by Mr. Hind, was also seen near
the sun on the day of its perihelion passage. That
discovered by Klinkerfues on the 10th of June, 1853,
and which passed its perihelion on the 1st of September,
was seen at Olmutz in the daytime, August
31, when only twelve degrees from the sun. After
passing its perihelion, it was again observed, <i>at noon</i>,
on the 2d, 3d, and 4th of September. Finally, the
great comet of 1861 was seen before sunset, on
Monday evening, July 1, by Rev. Henry W. Ballantine,
of Bloomington, Indiana. It was again detected
on the following evening just as the sun was
in the horizon.</p>

<p>Besides the thirteen comets which we have enumerated,
at least four others have been seen in
the daytime; all, however, under peculiar circumstances.
Seneca relates that during a great solar
eclipse, 63 years before our era, a large comet was
observed not far from the sun. "Philostorgius
says that on the 19th of July, <small>A.D.</small> 418, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the sun was eclipsed and stars were visible, a great
comet, in the form of a cone, was discovered near
that luminary, and was afterwards observed during
the nights."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The comet which passed its perihelion
on the 18th of November, 1826, was observed
by both Gambart and Flaugergues to transit the
solar disk,&mdash;the least distance of the nucleus from
the sun's surface being about 2,000,000 miles. The
second comet of 1819 and the comet of 1823 are
both known in like manner to have passed between
the sun and the earth. Unfortunately, however,
the transits were not observed.</p>

<p>A few cometary orbits are hyperbolas, more
ellipses, and a still greater number parabolas.
Comets moving in ellipses remain permanently
within the limits of solar influence. Others, however,
visit our system but once, and then pass off to
wander indefinitely in the sidereal spaces.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Comets of known periodicity.</i></p>

<p class="caption">I. Halley's Comet.</p>

<p>As comets are subject to great changes of appearance,
one can never be identified by any description
of its magnitude, brilliancy, etc., at the time of a
previous return. This can be done only by a comparison
of orbits. If, for example, we find the elements
of an orbit very nearly corresponding in every
particular with those of a former comet, there is a
degree of probability, amounting almost to cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>tainty,
that the two are identical. Sir Isaac Newton,
in his <i>Principia</i>, published shortly after the appearance
of the comet of 1682, explained how the periods
of those mysterious visitors might thus be ascertained,
thus directing the attention of astronomers
to the subject. Dr. Halley soon after undertook a
thorough discussion of all the recorded cometary
observations within his reach. In the course of his
investigations he discovered that the path of the
comet observed by Kepler in 1607 coincided almost
exactly with that of the one which passed its perihelion
in 1682. Hence he concluded that they were
the same. He found also that the comet of 1531,
whose course had been particularly observed by
Apian, moved in the same path. The interval
between the consecutive appearances being nearly
76 years, Halley announced this as the time of
the comet's revolution, and boldly predicted its
return in 1758 or 1759. The law of universal gravitation
had at this time just been discovered and
announced. But although its application to the
determination of planetary and cometary perturbations
had not been developed, Halley was well aware
that the attractive influence of Jupiter and Saturn
might accelerate or retard the motion of the comet,
so as to produce a considerable variation in its period.
During the interval from 1682 to 1759, the application
of the higher mathematics to problems in physical
astronomy had been studied with eminent success.
The disturbing effect of the two large planets,
Jupiter and Saturn, was computed with almost
incredible labor by Clairaut, Lalande, and Madame
Lepaute. The result as announced by Clairaut to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Academy of Sciences in November, 1758, was
that the period must be 618 days longer than that
immediately preceding, and that the comet accordingly
would pass its perihelion about the 13th of
April, 1759. It was stated, however, that, being
pressed for want of time, they had neglected certain
quantities which might somewhat affect the result.
The comet, in fact, passed its perihelion in March,
within less than a month of the predicted time.
When it is considered that the attraction of the
earth was not taken into the account, and that
Uranus, whose influence must have been sensible,
had not then been discovered, this must certainly
be regarded as a remarkable approximation.</p>

<p>But during the next interval of 76 years the theory
of planetary perturbations had been more perfectly
developed. The masses of Jupiter and Saturn had
been determined with greater accuracy, and Uranus
had been added to the known members of the planetary
system. A nearer approximation to the exact
time of the comet's perihelion passage in 1835 was
therefore to be expected. Prizes were offered by
two of the learned societies of Europe&mdash;the Academy
of Sciences at Turin, and the French Institute&mdash;for
the most perfect discussion of its motions. That of
the former was awarded to Damoiseau,&mdash;that of the
latter to Pontecoulant. The times assigned by these
distinguished mathematicians for the comet's perihelion
passage were very nearly the same, and differed
but a few days from the true time. Had the
present received mass of Jupiter been used in the
calculations, Pontecoulant, it is believed, would not
have been in error as much as 24 hours. It may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
proper to remark that, during the entire period from
1759 to 1835, the position of Neptune was such that
it could produce no considerable effect on the motion
of the comet.</p>

<p>This interesting object will again return about
1911.</p>

<p>The visit of 1531 was the earliest that Halley succeeded
in determining with any degree of certainty.
Peter Apian, by whom it was at that time observed,
was the first European to ascertain the fact that, as
a general thing, the tails of comets are turned from
the sun.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> To confirm this discovery, he carefully
followed the body in its progress through the constellations.
By means of his recorded observations
Halley was enabled to identify this comet with that
of 1607 and 1682. The great comet of 1456 he <i>conjectured</i>
to be the same, from the date of its appearance.
Pingr&eacute; subsequently confirmed this suspicion
by a careful examination of the few trustworthy
records that could be collected from the writers of
that period.</p>

<p>From the earlier descriptions of this comet we
infer that its brilliancy is gradually diminishing. In
1456 its tail, which was slightly curved like a sword
or sabre, extended two-thirds of the distance from the
horizon to the zenith. The appearance of such an
object, in a grossly superstitious age, excited throughout
Europe the utmost consternation. The Moslems
had just taken Constantinople, and were threatening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>to advance westward into Europe. Pope Calixtus
III., regarding the comet as confederate with
the Turk, ordered prayers to be offered three times
a day for deliverance from both. The alarm, however,
was of short duration. Within ten days of its
appearance the comet reached its perihelion. Receding
from the sun, the sword-like form began to
diminish in brilliancy and extent; and finally, to the
great relief of Europe, it entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>The perihelion passage of 1456 was, until recently,
the earliest known. It was shown by Laugier, however,
in 1843, that among the notices of comets extracted
by Edward Biot from the Chinese records,
were observations of a body in 1378, which was undoubtedly
the comet of Halley. Further researches
among these annals enabled the same astronomer to
recognize two ancient returns, one in 760, the other
in 451. Still more recently the distinguished English
astronomer, Mr. Hind, has traced back the returns
to the year 11 <small>B.C.</small> He remarks, however,
that previous to that epoch, "the Chinese descriptions
of comets are too vague to aid us in tracing
any more ancient appearances," and that "European
writers of these remote times render us no assistance."
Let us now inquire whether the comet had
probably made any former approach to the sun in
an orbit nearly identical with the present. It is
well known that the modern period of this body is
considerably less than the ancient. Thus, the mean
period since <small>A.D.</small> 1456 has been 75.88 years; while
from 11 <small>B.C.</small> to 1456 <small>A.D.</small> it was 77.27 years. In determining
the approximate dates of former returns,
the ancient period should evidently be employed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Now, it is a remarkable fact that of more than 70
comets,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or objects supposed to be comets, whose
appearance was recorded during the six centuries
immediately preceding the year 11 <small>B.C.</small>, but one&mdash;that
of 166 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;was observed at a date corresponding
nearly to that of a former return of Halley's
comet. Of this object it is merely recorded that "a
torch was seen in the heavens." Whether this was
a comet or some other phenomenon, it is impossible
to determine. But as the comet of Halley was
more brilliant in ancient than in modern times, it
seems highly improbable that seven <i>consecutive</i> returns
of so conspicuous an object should have been
unrecorded, especially as twelve comets per century<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
were observed during the same period. It would
appear, therefore, that the perihelion passage of
11 <small>B.C.</small> was in fact the first ever made by the comet,
or at least the first in an orbit nearly the same as
the present.</p>

<p>The motion of Halley's comet is retrograde. The
point of its nearest approach to the sun is situated
within the orbit of Venus. Its greatest distance
from the centre of the system is nearly twice that
of Uranus, or 36 times that of the earth. The
comet is, consequently, subject to great changes of
temperature. When nearest the sun its light and
heat are almost four times greater than the earth's;
when most remote, they are 1200 times less. In
the former position, the sun would appear much
larger than to us; in the latter, his apparent di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ameter
would not greatly exceed that of Jupiter, as
viewed from the earth. It would be difficult to conjecture
what the consequences might be, were our
planet transported to either of these extremes of
the cometary path. In the perihelion, the waters
of the ocean would undoubtedly be reduced to a
state of vapor; in the aphelion, they would be
solidified by congelation.</p>


<p class="caption">II. Encke's Comet.</p>

<p>It was formerly supposed that all comets have
their aphelia far beyond the limits of the planetary
system. In 1818, however, a small comet was discovered
by Pons, the orbit of which was subsequently
found to be wholly interior to that of Jupiter.
Its elements were presented by Bouvard, in
1819, to the Board of Longitude at Paris. The
form and position of the orbit were immediately
found to correspond with those of a comet observed
by several astronomers in 1805. The different appearances
were consequently regarded as returns of
the same body. Its elliptic orbit was calculated by
Encke, who found its period to be only about three
years and four months. Its perihelion is within the
orbit of Mercury; its aphelion, between the asteroids
and the orbit of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Encke's comet is invisible to the naked eye, except
in very favorable circumstances; it has no tail;
its motion, like that of the planets, is from west
to east; and its orbit is inclined about 13&deg; to the
ecliptic.</p>

<p>A comparison of the successive periods of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
interesting object has led to the discovery that its
time of revolution is gradually diminishing; a fact
regarded by Encke and other astronomers as indicating
the existence of an ethereal medium.</p>


<p class="caption">III. Biela's Comet.</p>

<p>The discovery of Encke's comet of short period
was followed, in 1826, by that of another, whose
revolution is completed in about six years and eight
months. It was observed on the 27th of February,
by M. Biela, an Austrian officer; accordingly it
has since been known as <i>Biela's comet</i>. On computing
its elements and comparing them with those
of former comets, it was found to have been observed
in 1772 and 1805. Damoiseau having calculated
the dimensions of the comet's elliptic path
and the time of its return, announced as the result
of his computations the remarkable fact that the
orbits of the earth and comet intersect each other,
and that the comet would cross the earth's path on
the 29th of October, 1832. This produced no little
alarm among the uneducated, especially in France.
Even some journalists are said to have predicted
the destruction of our globe by a collision with the
comet. When the latter, however, passed the point
of intersection at the predicted time, the earth was
at a distance of 50,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>At the return of 1845-6, Biela's comet exhibited
a most remarkable appearance. Instead of a single
comet, it appeared as two distinct bodies moving
together side by side, at a distance from each other
somewhat less than that of the moon from the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Astronomers, anxious to determine whether the
cometary fragments had continued separate during
an entire revolution, awaited the next return with
no ordinary interest. The <i>two</i> bodies appeared at
the predicted time (September, 1852); their distance
apart having increased to 1,250,000 miles. In 1859
the comet, on account of its proximity to the sun,
entirely escaped detection. At the return in 1865-6
the position of the object was quite favorable for
observation, yet the search of astronomers was
again unsuccessful. In 1872 the body escaped detection
both in Europe and America. One fragment
was seen, however, at Madras, India, on the
mornings of the 2d and 3d of December,&mdash;several
weeks after its perihelion passage. The comet's
non-appearance in 1866 and its greatly diminished
magnitude in 1872 leave no room to doubt its progressive
dissolution. This subject will again be referred
to in discussing the phenomena of meteoric
showers.</p>


<p class="caption">IV. Faye's Comet.</p>

<p>On the 22d of November, 1843, M. Faye, of the
Paris Observatory, discovered a comet, which was
shown by Dr. Goldschmidt to revolve in an elliptic
orbit, the perihelion of which is exterior to the
orbit of Mars, and the aphelion immediately beyond
that of Jupiter. The eccentricity is, therefore,
less than that of any other comet previously discovered.
Its period is about 7 years and 5 months.</p>

<p>It is possible that a comet moving in a parabola
or hyperbola, with the sun in the focus, may be
thrown into an elliptic orbit by the disturbing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>fluence
of Jupiter or one of the other large planets.
The celebrated Leverrier undertook to determine
whether the comet of Faye had in this manner
been recently fixed as a permanent member of the
solar system. He found that it could not have been
so introduced since 1747, and, consequently, that it
must have completed at least thirteen revolutions
before its discovery.</p>

<p>This comet has been observed at each return
from 1843 to the present time.</p>


<p class="caption">V. De Vico's Comet.</p>

<p>On the 22d of August, 1844, De Vico, of Rome,
discovered a comet whose orbit is included between
those of the earth and Jupiter. Its period is 1996
days, or about 5&frac12; years. This body, from some
cause,&mdash;perhaps a gradual dissolution,&mdash;has not
been observed at any subsequent return.</p>


<p class="caption">VI. Brorsen's Comet.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February, 1846, Mr. Brorsen, of
Kiel, discovered a faint comet, the mean distance
and period of which are almost identical with those
of De Vico's. This comet was not observed during
the perihelion passage of 1851, on account of its
unfavorable position with respect to the sun. It
has, however, been subsequently detected.</p>


<p class="caption">VII. D'Arrest's Comet.</p>

<p>Dr. D'Arrest discovered a comet on the 27th of
June, 1851, which was soon found to move in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
elliptic orbit, with a period of about 6&frac12; years. It
entirely escaped observation, both in Europe and
America, during its perihelion passage in 1857. It
was observed, however, at the Cape of Good Hope.
Its invisibility in 1864 was due to its unfavorable
position. At its return in 1870, it was first seen on
the 31st of August, by Dr. Winnecke, of Carlsruhe.</p>


<p class="caption">VIII. Tuttle's Comet.</p>

<p>A faint telescopic comet was discovered at the
Observatory of Harvard College, on the evening of
January 4, 1858, by Mr. H. P. Tuttle. The same
body was independently found one week later by
Dr. Bruhns, of Berlin. From observations made
at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Ann Arbor,
Michigan, its elements were soon computed by different
astronomers; the result in each case coinciding
so closely with the elements of the second
comet of 1790, as to place its identity wholly beyond
doubt. Its period is nearly 13 years and 8 months.
It had returned, therefore, without detection, in the
years 1803, 1817, 1831, and 1844. On its approach
to perihelion in 1871, it was first detected by M.
Borelly, of Marseilles.</p>


<p class="caption">IX. Winnecke's Comet.</p>

<p>The second comet of 1858 was discovered on the
8th of March, by Dr. Winnecke, of Bonn. This
proved to be identical with the third comet of 1819,
whose period was computed by Encke to be about
5&frac12; years. It had therefore returned unperceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
no less than six times between 1819 and 1858. At
its return in 1863 it again escaped detection. The
perihelion passage of 1869 was made on the 30th of
June. The comet was seen as early as April 13,
and, after passing the sun, as late as October 11.
"Sch&ouml;nfeld states that in part of April and May it
appeared to have not one, but several, centres of
condensation, and Vogel says that, in the beginning
of June, it had a much greater resemblance to a
star-cluster than to a nebula." This phenomenon,
it may be remarked, bore a striking resemblance to
the appearances observed in the comets of 389,
1618, and 1661.</p>


<p class="caption">X. Tempel's Comet.</p>

<p>On the 19th of December, 1865, M. Tempel, of
Marseilles, discovered a small comet, which continued
visible four weeks, passing its perihelion January
11, 1866. Dr. Oppolzer, of Vienna, after a
careful determination of its elements, announced
the interesting fact that its orbit very nearly intersects
those of the earth and Uranus; the perihelion
being situated immediately within the former, and
the aphelion a short distance exterior to the latter.
The period, according to the same astronomer, is
33 years and 65 days. The identity of this comet
with that of 1366 was suggested by Professor H. A.
Newton soon after its appearance,&mdash;a suggestion
which subsequent research has strongly corroborated.
It is also highly probable that the comet
observed in China, September 29, 1133, was a former
return of the same body. In 1366 it was con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>spicuous
to the naked eye, while in 1866 it was
wholly invisible without a telescope,&mdash;a fact indicative
of its gradual dissolution. The connection of
this comet with the meteors of November 14 will
be elsewhere considered.</p>


<p class="caption">XI. The Second Comet of 1867.</p>

<p>Another comet of short period was discovered by
M. Tempel on the 3d of April, 1867. Its orbit is
the least eccentric of all known comets: the perihelion
being exterior to the orbit of Mars; the
aphelion interior to that of Jupiter. Its motion is
direct, and it completes a revolution in 5 years and
8 months.</p>

<small>COMETS WHOSE ELEMENTS INDICATE PERIODICITY, BUT
WHOSE RETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNISED.</small></h3>


<p class="caption">I. The Group whose periods are nearly equal to that of
Uranus.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of the present century
five comets have been discovered, which form, with
Halley's, an interesting and remarkable group.
The first of these was detected by Pons, on the 20th
of July, 1812; the second by Olbers, on the 6th of
March, 1815; the third by De Vico, on the 28th of
February, 1846; the fourth by Brorsen, on the 20th
of July, 1847; and the last by Westphal, on the
27th of June, 1852. The periods of these bodies
are all nearly equal, ranging from 68 to 76 years;
their eccentricities are not greatly different; the
motions of all, except that of Halley's, are direct;
and the distances of their aphelia are somewhat
greater than Neptune's distance from the sun. Of
this group, the comets of 1812 and 1846 seem
worthy of special notice. The former became visible
to the naked eye shortly after its discovery, and
each continued visible about ten weeks. Their
elements are as follows:</p>

<p>The wonderful similarity of these elements, except
in the longitude of the ascending node, is at once
apparent. It will also be noticed that the longitude
of the <i>descending</i> node of the latter is very nearly
coincident with that of the <i>ascending</i> node of the
former. These remarkable coincidences are presented
to the eye in the following diagram, where
the dotted ellipse represents the orbit of the comet
of 1812, and the continuous curve that of the comet
of 1846.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>It is infinitely improbable that these coincidences
should be accidental; they point undoubtedly to a
common origin of the two bodies.</p>

<p>According to the theory now generally accepted,
comets enter the solar system <i>ab extra</i>, move in
parabolas or hyperbolas around the sun, and, if undisturbed
by the planets, pass off beyond the limits
of the sun's attraction, to be seen no more. If in
their motion, however, they approach very near any
of the larger planets, their direction is changed by
planetary perturbation,&mdash;their orbits being sometimes
transformed into ellipses. The new orbits of
such bodies would pass very nearly through the
points at which their greatest perturbation occurred;
and accordingly we find that the aphelia of a large
proportion of the periodic comets are near the orbits
of the major planets. "I admit," says M. Hoek,
"that the orbits of comets are by nature parabolas
or hyperbolas, and that in the cases when elliptical
orbits are met with, these are occasioned by planetary
attractions, or derive their character from the
uncertainty of our observations. To allow the contrary
would be to admit some comets as permanent
members of our planetary system, to which they
ought to have belonged since its origin, and so to
assert the simultaneous birth of that system and of
these comets. As for me, I attribute to these a
primitive wandering character. Traveling through
space, they move from one star to another in order
to leave it again, provided they do not meet any
obstacle that may force them to remain in its
vicinity. Such an obstacle was Jupiter, in the
neighborhood of our sun, for the comets of Lexell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and Brorsen, and probably for the greater part of
periodical comets; the other part of which may be
indebted for their elliptical orbits to the attractions
of Saturn and the remaining planets.</p>

<p>"Generally, then, comets come to us from some
star or other. The attraction of our sun modifies
their orbit, as had been done already by each star
through whose sphere of attraction they had passed.
We can put the question if they come as single
bodies or united in systems."</p>

<p>The conclusion of this astronomer's interesting
discussion is that&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>There are systems of comets in space that are broken
up by the attraction of our sun, and whose members attain,
as isolated bodies, the vicinity of the earth during a course
of several years.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the researches here referred to, it is shown by
Professor Hoek that the comets of 1860 III., 1863 I.,
and 1863 IV. formed a group in space previous to
their entrance into our system. The same fact has
also been demonstrated in regard to other comets
which need not here be specified. Now, the comets
of 1812 and 1846 IV. have their aphelia near the
orbit of Neptune, and hence the original parabolas
in which they moved were probably transformed
into ellipses by the perturbations of that planet.
Before entering the solar domain, they were doubtless
members of a cometary system. Passing
Neptune near the same time, and at some distance
from each other, their different relative positions
with regard to the disturbing body may account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
for the slight differences in the elements of their
orbits.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Comets of the Jovian Group.</i></p>

<p>Besides the eight comets enumerated in Chapter
II. whose aphelia are in the vicinity of Jupiter's orbit,
five others have been observed which belong apparently
to the same cluster. These are the comets
of 1585, 1743 I., 1766 II., 1783, and 1819 IV. "The
fact that these comets have not been re-observed on
their successive returns through perihelion may be
explained either by the difficulty of observing them,
owing to their unfavorable positions, and to the
circumstances of observers not expecting their reappearance,
their periodic character not being then
suspected, or because they may have been thrown
by the disturbing action of the larger planets into
orbits such as to keep them continually out of the
range of view of terrestrial observers."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Lexell's comet of 1770 is the most remarkable
instance known of the change produced in the
orbits of these bodies by planetary attraction. This
comet passed so near Jupiter in 1779 that the attraction
of the latter was 200 times greater than that of
the sun. The consequence was that the comet,
whose mean distance corresponded to a period of
5&frac12; years, was thrown into an orbit so entirely different
that it has never since been visible.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Peters' Comet.</span></p>

<p>A telescopic comet was discovered by Dr. Peters
on the 26th of June, 1846, which continued to be
observed till the 21st of July. Its period, according
to the discoverer, is about 13 years, and its aphelion,
like that of Tuttle's comet, is in the vicinity of
Saturn's orbit. It was expected to return in 1859,
and again in 1872, but each time escaped detection,
owing probably to the fact that its position was unfavorable
for observation.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Stephan's Comet</span> (1867 I.).</p>

<p>In January, 1867, M. Stephan, of Marseilles, discovered
a new comet, the elements of which, after
two months' observations, were computed by Mr.
G. M. Searle, of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The
perihelion of this body is near the orbit of Mars; its
aphelion near that of Uranus,&mdash;the least distance of
the orbits being about 2,000,000 miles. The present
form of the cometary path is doubtless due to the
disturbing action of Uranus. The comet completes
its revolution in 33.62 years; consequently (as has
been pointed out by Mr. J. R. Hind) five of its
periods are almost exactly equal to two periods of
Uranus. The next approximate appulse of the two
bodies will occur in 1985, when the form of the
comet's orbit may be sensibly modified.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Elliptic Comets whose Aphelia are at a much
Greater Distance than Neptune's Orbit.</span></p>

<p>In October, 1097, a comet was seen both in Europe
and China, which was noted for the fact of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
having two distinct tails, making with each other
an angle of about 40&deg;. From a discussion of the
Chinese observations (which extended through a
longer period than the European), Laugier concluded
that this body is identical with the third
comet of 1840, which was discovered by Galle on
the 6th of March. If, therefore, it has made no
intermediate return without being observed, it must
have a period of about 743 years. It is also highly
probable, from the similarity of elements, that the
comet which passed its perihelion on the 5th of June,
1845, was a reappearance of the comet of 1596,&mdash;the
period of revolution being 249 years. The elements
of the great comet of 1843 are somewhat uncertain.
There is a probability, however, of the identity of
this body with the comet of 1668. This would make
the period 175 years. The third comet of 1862 is
especially interesting from its connection with the
August meteors. Its period, according to Dr. Oppolzer,
is 121&frac12; years.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Great Comet of 1858</span></p>

<p class="noidt">was one of the most remarkable in the nineteenth
century. It was discovered on the 2d of June, by
Donati, of Florence, and first became visible to the
naked eye about the last of August. The comet
attained its greatest brilliancy about the 10th of
October, when its distance from the earth was
50,000,000 miles. The length of its tail somewhat
exceeded this distance. If, therefore, the comet had
been at that time directly between the sun and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
earth, the latter must have been enveloped for a
number of hours in the cometic matter.</p>

<p>The observations of this comet during a period of
five months enabled astronomers to determine the
elements of its orbit within small limits of error. It
completes a revolution, according to Newcomb, in
1854 years, in an orbit somewhat more eccentric
than that of Halley's comet. It will not return
before the 38th century, and will only reach its
aphelion about the year 2800. Its motion per second
when nearest the sun is 36 miles; when most remote,
only 234 yards.</p>

<small>OTHER REMARKABLE COMETS.</small></h3>


<p>It remains to describe some of the most remarkable
comets of which we have any record, but of
which we have no means of determining with certainty
whether they move in ellipses, parabolas, or
hyperbolas.</p>

<p>In the year 466 <small>B.C.</small>, a large comet appeared simultaneously
with the famous fall of meteoric stones
near &AElig;gospotamos. The former was supposed
by the ancients to have had some agency in producing
the latter phenomenon. Another of extraordinary
magnitude appeared in the year 373 <small>B.C.</small>
This comet was so bright as to throw shadows, and
its tail extended one-third of the distance from the
horizon to the zenith. The years 156, 136, 130, and
48, before our era, were also signalized by the appearance
of very large comets. The apparent magnitude
of the first of these is said to have equaled
that of the sun itself; while its light was sufficient
to diminish sensibly the darkness of the night.
The second is said to have filled a fourth part of
the celestial hemisphere. The comet of 130 B.C.,
sometimes called the comet of Mithridates, because
of its appearance about the time of his birth, is said
to have rivaled the sun in splendor.</p>

<p>In <small>A.D.</small> 178 a large comet was visible during a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
period of nearly three months. Its nucleus had a
remarkably red or fiery appearance, and the greatest
length of its tail exceeded 60&deg;. The most brilliant
comets of the sixth century were probably
those of 531 and 582. The train of the latter, as
seen in the west soon after sunset, presented the
appearance of a distant conflagration.</p>

<p>Great comets appeared in the years 975, 1264,
and 1556. Of these, the comet of 1264 had the
greatest apparent magnitude. It was first seen
early in July, and attained its greatest brilliancy in
the latter part of August, when its tail was 100&deg; in
length. It disappeared on the 3d of October, about
the time of the death of Pope Urban IV., of which
event the comet, in consequence of this coincidence,
was considered the precursor. These comets, on
account of the similarity of their elements, were
believed by many astronomers to be the same, and
to have a period of about 300 years. In the case of
identity, however, another reappearance should
have occurred soon after the middle of the nineteenth
century. As no such return was observed, we may
conclude that the comets were not the same, and
that their periods are wholly unknown.</p>

<p>The comet discovered on the 10th of November,
1618, was one of the largest in modern times; its
tail having attained the extraordinary length of
104&deg;. The comet of 1652, so carefully observed by
Hevelius, almost equaled the moon in apparent
magnitude. It shone, however, with a lurid, dismal
light. The tail of the comet of 1680 was 90&deg; in
length. This body is also remarkable for its near
approach to the sun; its least distance from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
solar surface having been only 147,000 miles. It
will always be especially memorable, however, for
having furnished Newton the data by means of
which he first showed that comets in their orbital
motions are governed by the same principle that
regulates the planetary revolutions.</p>

<p>Of all the comets which appeared during the eighteenth
century, that which passed its perihelion on the
7th of October, 1769, had the greatest apparent magnitude.
It was discovered by Messier on the 8th of
August, and continued to be observed till the 1st of
December. On the 11th of September the length
of its tail was 97&deg;. The comet discovered on the
26th of March, 1811, is in some respects the most
remarkable on record. It was observed during a
period of 16 months and 22 days,&mdash;the longest
period of visibility known. On account of its situation
with respect to the earth, the apparent length
of its tail was much less than that of some other
comets; its true length, however, was at one time
120,000,000 miles; and Sir William Herschel found
that on the 12th of October the greatest circular
section of the tail was 15,000,000 miles in diameter.
The same astronomer found the diameter of the
head of the comet to be 127,000 miles, and that of
the envelope at least 643,000. As a general thing,
the length of a comet-train increases very rapidly
as the body approaches the sun. But the perihelion
distance of the comet of 1811 was considerably
greater than the distance of the earth from the
sun; while its nearest approach to the earth was
110,000,000 miles. Its true magnitude, therefore,
has probably not been surpassed by any other ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>served;
and had its perihelion been very near the
sun, it must have exhibited an appearance of terrific
grandeur. This comet has an elliptic orbit, and its
period, according to Argelander, is 3065 years.</p>

<p>The great comet of 1861 was discovered on the
13th of May, by Mr. John Tebbut, Jr., of New
South Wales. In this country, as well as in Europe,
it was first generally observed on the evening
of June 30,&mdash;19 days after its perihelion passage.
Sir John Herschel, who observed it in Kent, England,
remarks that it far exceeded in brilliancy any
comets he had ever seen, not excepting those of
1811 and 1858. According to Father Secchi, of the
Collegio Romano, the length of its tail was 118&deg;.
This, with a single exception,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is the greatest on
record. The computed orbit is elliptical; the
period, 419 years.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE POSITION AND ARRANGEMENT OF COMETARY ORBITS.</small></h3>


<p>The cosmical masses from which comets are derived
seem to traverse in great numbers the interstellar
spaces. In consequence of the sun's progressive
motion, these nebulous bodies are sometimes
drawn toward the centre of our system. If,
in this approach, they are not disturbed by any of
the large planets, they again recede in parabolas or
hyperbolas. When, however, as must sometimes
be the case, they pass near Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
or Neptune, their orbits may be transformed into
elongated ellipses. The periodicity of many comets
may thus be accounted for.</p>

<p>In the present chapter it is proposed to consider
the probable consequences of the sun's motion
through regions of space in which cometary matter
is widely diffused; to compare our theoretical deductions
with observed phenomena; and thus refer
to their physical cause a variety of facts which have
hitherto received no satisfactory explanation.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>1. As comets, at least in many instances, owe
their periodicity to the disturbing action of the
major planets, and as this planetary influence is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sometimes sufficient, especially in the case of Jupiter
and Saturn, to change the <i>direction</i> of cometary
motion, the great majority of periodic comets should
move in the same direction with the planets. Now,
of the comets known to be elliptical, 70 per cent.
<i>have direct motion</i>. In this respect, therefore, theory
and observation are in striking harmony.</p>

<p>2. When the relative positions of a comet and
the disturbing planet are such as to give the transformed
orbit of the former a small perihelion distance,
the comet must return to the point at which
it received its greatest perturbation; in other words,
to the orbit of the planet. The aphelia of the comets
of short period ought therefore to be found, for the
most part, <i>in the vicinity of the orbits of the major planets</i>.
This, as already shown in Chapters II. and III., is
strikingly the case. The actual distances of these
aphelia, however, as compared with the respective
distances of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,
are presented at one view in the following tables:</p>

<p>The coincidences here pointed out (some of which
have been noticed by others) appear, then, to be
necessary consequences of the motion of the solar
system through spaces occupied by meteoric nebul&aelig;.
Hence the observed facts receive an obvious explanation.</p>

<p>In regard to comets of long period we have only
to remark that, for anything we know to the contrary,
there may be causes of perturbation far exterior
to the orbit of Neptune.</p>

<p>3. From what we observe in regard to the <i>larger</i>
bodies of the universe&mdash;a clustering tendency being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
everywhere apparent,&mdash;it seems highly improbable
that cometic matter should be uniformly distributed
in the sidereal spaces. We would expect, on the
contrary, to find it collected in groups or clusters.
This view is also in remarkable harmony with the
facts of observation. In 150 years, from 1600 to
1750, 16 comets were visible to the naked eye; of
which 8 appeared in the 25 years from 1664 to 1689.
Again, during 60 years, from 1750 to 1810, only 5
comets were visible to the naked eye, while in
the next 50 years there were double that number.
The probable cause of such variations is sufficiently
obvious. As the sun in its progressive
motion approaches a cometary group, the latter is
drawn toward the centre of our system; the nearer
members with greater velocity than the more remote.
Those of the same cluster would enter the
solar domain at periods not very distant from each
other; the forms of their orbits depending upon
their original relative positions with reference to
the sun's course, and also on planetary perturbations.
It is evident also that the passage of the
solar system through a region of space comparatively
destitute of cometic clusters would be indicated
by a corresponding paucity of comets.</p>

<p>4. The line of apsides of a large proportion of
comets will be approximately coincident with the
solar orbit. The point towards which the sun is
moving is in longitude about 260&deg;. The quadrants
bisected by this point and that directly opposite
extend from 215&deg; to 305&deg;, and from 35&deg; to 125&deg;.
The number of cometary perihelia found in these
quadrants up to July, 1868 (periodic comets being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
counted but once) was 159, or 62 per cent.; in the
other two quadrants, 98, or 38 per cent.</p>

<p>This tendency of the perihelia to crowd together
in two opposite regions has been noticed by different
writers.</p>

<p>5. Comets whose positions before entering our
system were very remote from the solar orbit must
have <i>overtaken</i> the sun in its progressive motion;
hence their perihelia must fall, for the most part, in
the vicinity of the point towards which the sun is
moving; and they must in general have very small
perihelion distances. Now, what are the observed
facts in regard to the longitudes of the perihelia of
the comets which have approached within the least
distance of the sun's surface? But three have had a
perihelion distance less than 0.01. <i>All</i> these, it will
be seen by the following table, have their perihelia
in close proximity to the point referred to:</p>

<p>With greater perihelion distances the tendency of
the perihelia to crowd together round the point indicated
is less distinctly marked.</p>

<p>6. Few comets of small perihelion distance should
have their perihelia in the vicinity of longitude 80&deg;,
the point opposite that towards which the sun is
moving. Accordingly we find, by examining a
table of cometary elements, that with a perihelion
distance less than 0.1 there is not a single perihelion
between 35&deg; and 125&deg;; between 0.1 and 0.2 but 3;
and between 0.2 and 0.3 only 1.</p>

<small>THE DISINTEGRATION OF COMETS.</small></h3>


<p>The <i>fact</i> that in several instances meteoric streams
move in orbits identical with those of certain comets
was first established by the researches of Signor
Schiaparelli. The <i>theory</i>, however, of an intimate
relationship between comets and meteors was advocated
by the writer as long since as 1861,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;several
years previous to the publication of Schiaparelli's
memoirs. In the essay here referred to it was
maintained&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That meteors and meteoric rings "are the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of ancient but now disintegrated comets whose matter
has become distributed around their orbits."</p>

<p>2. That the separation of Biela's comet as it approached
the sun in December, 1845, was but one
in a series of similar processes which would probably
continue until the individual fragments would
become invisible.</p>

<p>3. That certain luminous meteors have entered
the solar system from the interstellar spaces.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>4. That the orbits of some meteors and periodic
comets have been transformed into ellipses by planetary
perturbation; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>5. That numerous facts&mdash;some observed in ancient
and some in modern times&mdash;have been decidedly
indicative of cometary disintegration.</p>

<p>What was thus proposed as theory has been since
confirmed as undoubted facts. When the hypothesis
was originally advanced, the data required for
its mathematical demonstration were entirely wanting.
The evidence, however, by which it was sustained
was sufficient to give it a high degree of
probability.</p>

<p>The existence of a divellent force by which comets
near their perihelia have been separated into parts
is clearly shown by the following facts. Whether
this force, as suggested by Schiaparelli, is simply the
unequal attraction of the sun on different parts of
the nebulous mass, or whether, in accordance with
the views of other astronomers, it is to be regarded
as a cosmical force of repulsion, is a question left for
future discussion.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Historical Facts.</span></p>

<p>1. Seneca informs us that Ephoras, a Greek writer
of the fourth century before Christ had recorded the
singular fact of a comet's separation into two distinct
parts.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This statement was deemed incredible by
the Roman philosopher, inasmuch as the occurrence
was then without a parallel. More recent observations
of similar phenomena leave no room to question
the historian's veracity.</p>

<p>2. The head of the great comet of <small>A.D.</small> 389, ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>cording
to the writers of that period, was "composed
of several small stars." (Hind's "Comets," p. 103.)</p>

<p>3. On June 27, <small>A.D.</small> 416, two comets appeared in
the constellation Hercules, and pursued nearly the
same apparent path. Probably at a former epoch
the pair had constituted a single comet.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>4. On August 4, 813, "a comet was seen which
resembled two moons joined together." They subsequently
separated, the fragments assuming different
forms.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>5. The Chinese annals record the appearance of
three comets&mdash;one large and two smaller ones&mdash;at
the same time, in the year 896 of our era. "They
traveled together for three days. The little ones
disappeared first, and then the large one."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
bodies were probably fragments of a large comet
which, on approaching the sun, had been separated
into parts a short time previous to the date of their
discovery.</p>

<p>6. <i>The third comet of 1618.</i>&mdash;The great comet of
1618 exhibited decided symptoms of disintegration.
When first observed (on November 30), its appearance
was that of a lucid and nearly spherical mass.
On the eighth day the process of division was distinctly
noticed, and on the 20th of December it
resembled a cluster of small stars.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>7. <i>The comet of 1661.</i>&mdash;The elements of the comets
of 1532 and 1661 have a remarkable resemblance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and previous to the year 1790 astronomers regarded
the bodies as identical. The similarity of the elements
is seen at a glance in the following table:</p>

<div class='center'>

</table></div>

<p>The elements of the former are by Olbers; those
of the latter by Mechain. The return of the comet
about 1790, though generally expected, was looked
for in vain. As a possible explanation of this fact,
it is interesting to recur to an almost forgotten statement
of Hevelius. This astronomer observed in the
comet of 1661 an apparent breaking up of the body
into separate fragments.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The case may be analogous
to that of Biela's comet.</p>

<p>8. The identity of the comets of 1866 and 1366,
first suggested by Professor H. A. Newton, is now
unquestioned. The existence then of a meteoric
swarm, moving in the same track, is not the only
evidence of the original comet's partial dissolution.
The comet of 1866 was invisible to the naked eye;
that of 1366, seen under nearly similar circumstances,
was a conspicuous object. The statement
of the Chinese historian that "it appeared nearly as
large as a tow measure,"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> though somewhat indefinite,
certainly justifies the conclusion that its magnitude
has greatly diminished during the last 500
years. The meteors moving in the same orbit are
doubtless the products of this gradual separation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>9. The repartition of Biela's comet in 1845, as
well as the non-appearance of the two fragments in
1865 and 1872,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> were referred to in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>The comet of Halley, if we may credit the descriptions
given by ancient writers, has been decreasing
in brilliancy from age to age. The same is true in
regard to several others believed to be periodic. The
comet of <small>A.D.</small> 1097 had a tail 50&deg; long. At its return,
in March, 1840, the length of its tail was only 5&deg;.
The third comet of 1790 and the first of 1825 are
supposed, from the similarity of their elements,
to be identical. Each perihelion passage occurred
in May, yet the tail at the former appearance was
4&deg; in length, at the latter but 2&frac12;&deg;. Other instances
might be specified of this apparent gradual dissolution.
It would seem, indeed, extremely improbable
that the particles driven off from comets in
their approach to the sun, forming tails extending
millions of miles from the principal mass, should
again be collected around the same nuclei.</p>

<p>The fact, then, that meteors move in the same
orbits with comets is but a consequence of that disruptive
process so clearly indicated by the phenomena
described. In this view of the subject,
comets&mdash;even such as move in elliptic orbits&mdash;are
not to be regarded as permanent members of the
solar system. Their <i>d&eacute;bris</i> becomes gradually scattered
around the orbit. Some parts of the nebulous
ring will be more disturbed than others by planet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ary
perturbation. Portions of such streams as
nearly intersect the earth's path sometimes penetrate
the atmosphere. Their rapid motion renders
them luminous. If very minute, they are burnt up
or dissipated without leaving any solid deposit; we
then have the phenomena of <i>shooting-stars</i>. When,
however, as is sometimes the case, they contain a
considerable quantity of solid matter, they reach
the earth's surface as <i>meteoric stones</i>.</p>

<small>METEORIC STONES.</small></h3>


<p>Although numerous instances of the fall of aerolites
had been recorded, some of them apparently
well authenticated, the occurrence long appeared
too marvelous and improbable to gain credence
with scientific men. Such a shower of rocky fragments
occurred, however, on the 26th of April,
1803, at L'Aigle, in France, as forever to dissipate
all doubt on the subject. Similar displays since
that time have been frequently witnessed;&mdash;indeed
scarcely a year passes without the fall of meteoric
stones in some part of the earth, either singly or in
clusters. It would not comport with the design of
the present treatise to give an extended list of these
phenomena. The following account, however, includes
the most important instances in which the
fall of meteoric stones has been actually observed:</p>

<p>(1.) 1478 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;According to the celebrated Parian
chronicle, an aerolite, or <i>thunder-stone</i>, as it
was called, fell in the island of Crete, about 1478
years before the Christian era. This is undoubtedly
the most ancient stone-fall on record. Meteoric
masses have been <i>found</i>, however, the fall of
which <i>probably</i> occurred at an epoch still more
ancient.</p>

<p>(2.) 1200 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;A number of stones, which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
anciently preserved in Orchomenos, a town of
B&#339;otia, were said to have fallen from heaven about
twelve centuries before our era.</p>

<p>(3.) 1168 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;A mass of iron, as we learn from
the Parian chronicle, was seen to descend upon
Mount Ida, in Crete.</p>

<p>(4.) 654 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;According to Livy, a number of
meteoric stones fell on the Alban Hill, near Rome,
about the year 654 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>(5.) 616 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>January</i> 14.&mdash;It is related in the
Chinese annals that on the 14th of January, 616
<small>B.C.</small>, a meteoric stone-fall broke several chariots and
killed ten men.</p>

<p>(6.) 466 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;A mass of rock, described as "of
the size of two millstones," fell at &AElig;gospotamos,
in Thrace. An attempt to rediscover this meteoric
mass, so celebrated in antiquity, was recently made,
but without success. Notwithstanding this failure,
Humboldt expressed the hope that, as such a body
would be difficult to destroy, it may yet be found,
"since the region in which it fell is now become so
easy of access to European travelers."</p>

<p>(7.) 465 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;The famous stone called the "Mother
of the Gods," and which is described or alluded
to by many ancient writers, was said to have fallen
from the skies. The poet Pindar was seated on a
hill at the time of its descent, and the meteorite
struck the earth near his feet. The stone, as it fell,
was <i>encircled by fire</i>. "It is said to have been of
moderate dimensions, of a black hue, of an irregular,
angular shape, and of a metallic aspect. An
oracle had predicted that the Romans would continue
to increase in prosperity if they were put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in possession of this precious deposit; and Publius
Scipio Nasico was accordingly deputed to Attalus,
King of Pergamus, to obtain and receive the sacred
idol, whose worship was instituted at Rome 204
years before the Christian era."&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Encyclopedia.</i></p>

<p>(8.) <small>A.D.</small> 921.&mdash;An immense aerolite fell into the
river (a branch of the Tiber) at Narni, in Italy. It
projected three or four feet above the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>(9.) 1492, <i>November</i> 7.&mdash;An aerolite, weighing
276 pounds, fell at Ensisheim, in Alsace, penetrating
the earth to the depth of three feet. This
stone, or the greater part of it, may still be seen at
Ensisheim.</p>

<p>(10.) 1511, <i>September</i> 14.&mdash;At noon an almost
total darkening of the heavens occurred at Crema.
"During this midnight gloom," says a writer of
that period, "unheard-of thunders, mingled with
awful lightnings, resounded through the heavens....
On the plain of Crema, where never before
was seen a stone the size of an egg, there fell
pieces of rock of enormous dimensions and of immense
weight. It is said that ten of these were
found, weighing 100 pounds each." A monk was
struck dead at Crema by one of these rocky fragments.
This terrific display is said to have lasted
two hours, and 1200 aerolites were subsequently
found.</p>

<p>(11.) 1637, <i>November</i> 29.&mdash;A stone, weighing 54
pounds, fell on Mount Vaison, in Provence.</p>

<p>(12.) 1650, <i>March</i> 30.&mdash;A Franciscan monk was
killed at Milan by the fall of a meteoric stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>(13.) 1674.&mdash;Two Swedish sailors were killed on
shipboard by the fall of an aerolite.</p>

<p>(14.) 1751, <i>May</i> 26.&mdash;Two meteoric masses, consisting
almost wholly of iron, fell near Agram, the
capital of Croatia. The larger fragment, which
weighs 72 pounds, is now in Vienna.</p>

<p>(15.) 1790, <i>July</i> 24.&mdash;Between 9 and 10 o'clock
at night a very large meteor was seen near Bordeaux,
France. Over Barbotan a loud explosion
was heard, which was followed by a shower of meteoric
stones of various magnitudes.</p>

<p>(16.) 1794, <i>July.</i>&mdash;A fall of about a dozen aerolites
occurred at Sienna, Tuscany.</p>

<p>(17.) 1795, <i>December</i> 13.&mdash;A large meteoric
stone fell near Wold Cottage, in Yorkshire, England.
"Several persons heard the report of an explosion
in the air, followed by a hissing sound; and
afterward felt a shock, as if a heavy body had fallen
to the ground at a little distance from them. One
of these, a plowman, saw a huge stone falling toward
the earth, eight or nine yards from the place
where he stood. It threw up the mould on every
side; and after penetrating through the soil, lodged
some inches deep in solid chalk-rock. Upon being
raised, the stone was found to weigh 56 pounds. It
fell in the afternoon of a mild, but hazy day, during
which there was no thunder or lightning; and the
noise of the explosion was heard through a considerable
district."&mdash;<i>Milner's Gallery of Nature</i>, p. 134.</p>

<p>(18.) 1796, <i>February</i> 19.&mdash;A stone of 10 pounds'
weight fell in Portugal.</p>

<p>(19.) 1803, <i>April</i> 26.&mdash;This remarkable shower
was referred to on a previous page. At 1 o'clock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<small>P.M.</small>, the heavens being almost cloudless, a tremendous
noise, like that of thunder, was heard, and at
the same time an immense fire-ball was seen moving
with great rapidity through the atmosphere.
This was followed by a violent explosion, which
lasted several minutes, and which was heard not
only at L'Aigle, but in every direction around it to
the distance of 70 miles. Immediately after, a great
number of meteoric stones fell to the earth, generally
penetrating to some distance beneath the surface.
Nearly 3000 of these fragments were found
and collected, the largest weighing about 17 pounds.
The occurrence very naturally excited great attention.
M. Biot, under the authority of the government,
repaired to the place, collected the various
facts in regard to the phenomenon, took the testimony
of witnesses, etc., and finally embraced the
results of his investigations in an elaborate memoir.</p>

<p>(20.) 1807, <i>December</i> 14.&mdash;A large meteor exploded
over Weston, Connecticut. The height, direction,
velocity and magnitude of this body were
discussed by Dr. Bowditch in a memoir communicated
to the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences in 1815. The appearance of the meteor
occurred about 6h. 15m. <small>A.M.</small>,&mdash;just after daybreak.
Its apparent diameter was half that of the full
moon; its time of flight, about 30 seconds. Within
less than a minute from the time of its disappearance
three distinct reports, like those of artillery,
were heard over an area several miles in diameter.
Each explosion was followed by the fall of meteoric
stones. Unlike most aerolites, these bodies when
first found were so soft as to be easily pulverized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
between the fingers. On exposure to the air, however,
they gradually hardened. The weight of the
largest fragment was 35 pounds.</p>

<p>(21.) 1859, <i>November</i> 15.&mdash;Between 9 and 10
o'clock in the morning an extraordinary meteor
was seen in several of the New England States,
New York, New Jersey, the District of Columbia,
and Virginia. The apparent diameter of the head
was nearly equal to that of the sun, and it had a
train, notwithstanding the bright sunshine, several
degrees in length. Its disappearance on the coast
of the Atlantic was followed by a series of the most
terrific explosions. It is believed to have descended
into the water, probably into Delaware Bay. A
highly interesting account of this meteor, by Professor
Loomis, may be found in the <i>American Journal
of Science and Arts</i> for January, 1860.</p>

<p>(22.) 1860, <i>May</i> 1.&mdash;About 20 minutes before 1
o'clock, <small>P.M.</small>, a shower of meteoric stones fell in the
southwest corner of Guernsey county, Ohio. Full
accounts of the phenomena are given in <i>Silliman's
Journal</i> for July, 1860, and January and July, 1861,
by Professors E. B. Andrews, E. W. Evans, J. L.
Smith, and D. W. Johnson. From these interesting
papers we learn that the course of the meteor was
about 40&deg; west of north. Its visible track was over
Washington and Noble counties, and the prolongation
of its projection, on the earth's surface, passes
directly through New Concord, in the southeast
corner of Muskingum county. The meteor when
first seen was about 40 miles from the earth's surface.
The sky, at the time, was for the most part
covered with clouds over northwestern Ohio, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that if any portion of the meteoric mass continued
on its course it was invisible. The velocity of the
meteor, in relation to the earth's surface, was from
three to four miles per second; and hence its absolute
velocity in the solar system must have been
somewhat greater than that of the earth.</p>

<p>"At New Concord,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Muskingum county, where
the meteoric stones fell, and in the immediate
neighborhood, there were many distinct and loud
reports heard. At New Concord there was first
heard in the sky, a little southeast of the zenith, a
loud detonation, which was compared to that of a
cannon fired at the distance of half a mile. After
an interval of ten seconds, another similar report.
After two or three seconds another, and so on with
diminishing intervals. Twenty-three distinct detonations
were heard, after which the sounds became
blended together and were compared to the
rattling fire of an awkward squad of soldiers, and
by others to the roar of a railway train. These
sounds, with their reverberations, are thought to
have continued for two minutes. The last sounds
seemed to come from a point in the southeast 45&deg;
below the zenith. The result of this cannonading was
the falling of a large number of stony meteorites upon
an area of about 10 miles long by 3 wide. The sky
was cloudy, but some of the stones were seen first
as 'black specks', then as 'black birds', and finally
falling to the ground. A few were picked up within
20 or 30 minutes. The warmest was no warmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
than if it had lain on the ground exposed to the
sun's rays. They penetrated the earth from two to
three feet. The largest stone, which weighed 103
pounds, struck the earth at the foot of a large oak-tree,
and, after cutting off two roots, one five inches
in diameter, and grazing a third root, it descended
two feet ten inches into hard clay. This stone was
found resting under a root that was not cut off.
This would seemingly imply that it entered the
earth obliquely."</p>

<p>Over thirty of the stones which fell were discovered,
while doubtless many, especially of the smaller,
being deeply buried beneath the soil, entirely escaped
observation. The weight of the largest ten
was 418 pounds.</p>

<p>(23.) 1860, <i>July</i> 14.&mdash;About 2 o'clock <small>P.M.</small> on
the 14th of July, 1860, a shower of aerolites fell at
Dhurmsala, in India. The fall was attended by a
tremendous detonation, which greatly terrified the
inhabitants of the district. The natives, supposing
the stones to have been thrown by some of their
deities from the summit of the Himalayas, carried
off many fragments to be kept as objects of religious
veneration. Lord Canning and Mr. J. R. Saunders
succeeded, however, in obtaining numerous specimens,
which they forwarded to the British Museum
and several European cabinets. They are earthy
aerolites, of a specific gravity somewhat greater
than that of granite.</p>

<p>(24.) 1864, <i>May</i> 14.&mdash;Early in the evening a very
large and brilliant meteor was seen in France,
from Paris to the Spanish border. At Montauban
and in the vicinity loud explosions were heard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
which were followed by showers of meteoric stones
near the villages of Orgueil and Nohic. The principal
facts in regard to the meteor are the following:</p>

<p>"This example," says Professor Newton, "affords
the strongest proof that the detonating and stone-producing
meteors are phenomena not essentially
unlike."</p>

<p>(25.) 1868, <i>January</i> 30.&mdash;It is obviously a matter
of much importance that the composition and
general characteristics of aerolites, together with
the phenomena attending their fall, should be carefully
noted; as such facts have a direct bearing on
the theory of their origin. In this regard the memoirs
of Professors J. G. Galle, of Breslau, and G.
vom Rath, of Bonn, on a meteoric fall which occurred
at Pultusk, Poland, on the 30th of January,
1868, have more than ordinary interest. These memoirs
establish the fact that the aerolites of the
Pultusk shower <i>entered our atmosphere</i> as a swarm or
cluster of distinct meteoric masses. It is shown,
moreover, by Dr. Galle that this meteor-group had
a proper motion when it entered the solar system of
at least from 4&frac12; to 7 miles per second.</p>

<p>The foregoing list contains but a small proportion
of the meteoric stones whose fall has been actually
observed. But, besides these, other masses have
been found so closely similar in structure to aerolites
whose descent has been witnessed, as to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
no doubt in regard to their origin. One of these is
a mass of iron and nickel, weighing 1680 pounds,
found by the traveler Pallas, in 1749, at Abakansk,
in Siberia. This immense aerolite may be seen in
the Imperial Museum at St. Petersburg. On the
plain of Otumpa, in Buenos Ayres, is a meteoric
mass 7&frac12; feet in length, partly buried in the ground.
Its estimated weight is about 16 tons. A specimen
of this stone, weighing 1400 pounds, has been removed
and deposited in one of the rooms of the
British Museum. A similar block, of meteoric
origin, weighing more than six tons, was discovered
some years since in the province of Bahia, in
Brazil.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>1. A Committee on Luminous Meteors was appointed
several years since by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science. This committee,
consisting at present of James Glaisher,
F.R.S., Robert P. Greg, F.R.S., Alexander S. Herschel,
F.R.A.S., and Charles Brooke, F.R.S., report
from year to year not only their own observations
on aerolites, fire-balls, and falling stars, but also such
facts bearing upon the subject as can be derived
from other sources. An analysis of these reports
justifies the conclusion that meteoric stone-falls, like
star-showers, occur with greater frequency than
usual on or about particular days. These epochs,
established with more or less certainty, are the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It is worthy of remark that no new elements
have been found in meteoric stones. Humboldt, in
his "Cosmos," called attention to this interesting
fact. "I would ask," he remarks, "why the elementary
substances that compose one group of cosmical
bodies, or one planetary system, may not in a great
measure be identical? Why should we not adopt
this view, since we may conjecture that those planetary
bodies, like all the larger or smaller agglomerated
masses revolving round the sun, have been
thrown off from the once far more expanded solar
atmosphere, and have been formed from vaporous
rings describing their orbits round the central body?"</p>

<p>3. But while aerolites contain no elements but
such as are found in the earth's crust, the manner
in which these elements are combined and arranged
is so peculiar that a skillful mineralogist will readily
distinguish them from terrestrial substances.</p>

<p>4. Of the eighteen or nineteen elements hitherto
observed in meteoric stones, iron is found in the
greatest abundance. The specific gravities vary from
1.94 to 7.901: the former being that of the stone of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Alais; the latter that of the meteorite of Wayne
county, Ohio, described by Professor J. L. Smith in
<i>Silliman's Journal</i> for November, 1864, p. 385.</p>

<p>5. The average number of aerolitic falls in a year
was estimated by Schreibers at 700. Baron Reichenbach,
however, after a discussion of the data at hand,
makes the number much larger. He regards the
probable annual average for the entire surface of the
earth as not less than 4500. This would give twelve
daily falls. They are of every variety as to magnitude,
from a weight of less than a single ounce to over
fifteen tons. The baron even suspects the meteoric
origin of large masses of dolerite which all former
geologists had considered native to our planet.</p>

<p>6. An analysis of any extensive table of meteorites
and fire-balls proves that a greater number of
aerolitic falls have been observed during the months
of June and July, when the earth is near its aphelion,
than in December and January, when near its
perihelion. It is found, however, that the reverse
is true in regard to bolides, or fire-balls. These
facts are susceptible of an obvious explanation. The
fall of meteoric stones would be more likely to escape
observation by night than by day, on account of the
relatively small number of observers. But the days
are shortest when the earth is in perihelion, and
longest when in aphelion; the ratio of their lengths
being nearly equal to that of the corresponding numbers
of aerolitic falls. On the other hand, it is obvious
that fire-balls, unless very large, would not be visible
during the day. The <i>observed</i> number will therefore
be greatest when the nights are longest; that is,
when the earth is near its perihelion. This, it will be
found, is precisely in accordance with observation.</p>

<small>SHOOTING-STARS.&mdash;METEORS OF NOVEMBER 14.</small></h3>


<p>Although shooting-stars have doubtless been observed
in all ages of the world, it is only within the
last half century that they have attracted the special
attention of scientific men. A few efforts had been
made to determine the height of such meteors, but
the first general interest in the subject was excited
by the brilliant meteoric display of November 13,
1833. This shower of fire can never be forgotten
by those who witnessed it. The meteors were observed
from the West Indies to British America,
and from 60&deg; to 100&deg; west longitude from Greenwich.
As early as 10 o'clock on the evening of the
12th shooting-stars were observed with unusual frequency;
their motions being generally westward.
Soon after midnight their numbers became so extraordinary
as to attract the attention of all who
happened to be in the open air. The meteors, however,
became more and more numerous till 4, or
half past 4, o'clock; and the fall did not entirely
cease till ten minutes before sunrise. From 2 to 6
o'clock the numbers were so great as to defy all
efforts at counting them; while their brilliancy was
such that persons sleeping in rooms with uncurtained
windows were aroused by their light. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
meteors varied in apparent magnitude from the
smallest visible points to fire-balls equaling the moon
in diameter. Occasionally one of the larger class
would separate into several parts, and in some instances
a luminous train remained visible for three or
four minutes. No sound whatever accompanied the
display. It was noticed by many observers that all
the meteors diverged from a point near the star
<i>Gamma Leonis</i>; in other words, their paths if traced
backward would intersect each other at a particular
locality in the constellation Leo. In some parts of
the country the inhabitants were completely terror-stricken
by the magnificence of the display. In the
afternoon of the day on which the shower occurred
the writer met with an illiterate farmer who, after
describing the phenomena as witnessed by himself,
remarked that "the stars continued to fall till none
were left," and added, "I am anxious to see how
the heavens will appear this evening; I believe we
shall see no more stars." A gentleman of South
Carolina described the effect on the negroes of his
plantation as follows:&mdash;"I was suddenly awakened
by the most distressing cries that ever fell on my
ears. Shrieks of horror and cries for mercy I could
hear from most of the negroes of the three plantations,
amounting in all to about 600 or 800. While
earnestly listening for the cause I heard a faint
voice near the door, calling my name. I arose, and,
taking my sword, stood at the door. At this moment
I heard the same voice still beseeching me to
arise, and saying, 'O my God, the world is on fire!'
I then opened the door, and it is difficult to say
which excited me the most,&mdash;the awfulness of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
scene, or the distressed cries of the negroes. Upwards
of a hundred lay prostrate on the ground,&mdash;some
speechless, and some with the bitterest cries,
but with their hands raised, imploring God to save
the world and them. The scene was truly awful; for
never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors
fell towards the earth; east, west, north, and south,
it was the same."</p>

<p>At the time of this wonderful meteoric display
Captain Hammond, of the ship <i>Restitution</i>, had just
arrived at Salem, Massachusetts, where he observed
the phenomenon from midnight till daylight. He
recollected with astonishment that precisely one
year before, viz., on the 13th of November, 1832, he
had observed a similar appearance (although the
meteors were less numerous) at Mocha, in Arabia.
It was found, moreover, as a further and most remarkable
coincidence, that an extraordinary fall of
meteors had been witnessed on the 12th of November,
1799. This was seen and described by Andrew
Ellicott, Esq., who was then at sea near Cape
Florida. It was also observed by Humboldt and
Bonpland, in Cumana, South America. Baron
Humboldt's description of the shower is as follows:&mdash;"From
half after two, the most extraordinary luminous
meteors were seen toward the east. Thousands
of bolides and falling stars succeeded each other
during four hours. They filled a space in the sky
extending from the true east 30&deg; toward the north
and south. In an amplitude of 60&deg; the meteors
were seen to rise above the horizon at E.N.E. and
at E., describe arcs more or less extended, and fall
toward the south, after having followed the direc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>tion
of the meridian. Some of them attained a
height of 40&deg;, and all exceeded 25&deg; or 30&deg;. Mr.
Bonpland relates, that from the beginning of the
phenomenon there was not a space in the firmament
equal in extent to three diameters of the moon, that
was not filled at every instant with bolides and falling
stars. The Guaiqueries in the Indian suburb
came out and asserted that the firework had begun
at one o'clock. The phenomenon ceased by degrees
after four o'clock, and the bolides and falling stars
became less frequent; but we still distinguished
some toward the northeast a quarter of an hour
after sunrise."</p>

<p>This wonderful correspondence of dates excited
a very lively interest throughout the scientific world.
It was inferred that a recurrence of the phenomenon
might be expected, and accordingly arrangements
were made for systematic observations on the 12th,
13th, and 14th of November. The periodicity of
the shower was thus, in a very short time, placed
wholly beyond question. The facts in regard to
the phenomena of November 13, 1833, were collected
and discussed by Olmsted, Twining, and
other astronomers. The inquiry, however, very
naturally arose whether any trace of the same meteoric
group could be found in ancient times. To
determine this question many old historical records
were ransacked by the indefatigable scientist, Edward
C. Herrick, in our own country, and by Arago,
Quetelet, and others, in Europe. These examinations
led to the discovery of ten undoubted returns
of the November shower previous to that of 1799.
The descriptions of these former meteoric falls are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
given by Professor H. A. Newton in the <i>American
Journal of Science</i>, for May, 1864. They occurred
in the years 902, 931, 934, 1002, 1101, 1202, 1366,
1533, 1602, and 1698. Historians represent the meteors
of <small>A.D.</small> 902 as innumerable, and as moving
like rain in all directions. The exhibition of 1202
was scarcely less magnificent. "On the last day of
Muharrem," says a writer of that period, "stars
shot hither and thither in the heavens, eastward and
westward, and flew against one another like a scattering
swarm of locusts, to the right and left; this
phenomenon lasted until daybreak; people were
thrown into consternation, and cried to God the
Most High with confused clamor." The shower of
1366 is thus described in a Portuguese chronicle,
quoted by Humboldt: "In the year 1366, twenty-two
days of the month of October being past, three
months before the death of the king, Don Pedro
(of Portugal), there was in the heavens a movement
of stars such as men never before saw or heard of.
At midnight, and for some time after, all the stars
moved from the east to the west; and after being
collected together, they began to move, some in one
direction and others in another. And afterward
they fell from the sky in such numbers, and so
thickly together, that as they descended low in the
air they seemed large and fiery, and the sky and
the air seemed to be in flames, and even the earth
appeared as if ready to take fire. That portion of
the sky where there were no stars seemed to be
divided into many parts, and this lasted for a long
time."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">The Showers of 1866-9.</p>

<p>The fact that all great displays of the November
meteors have taken place at intervals of 33 or 34
years, or some multiple of that period, had led to a
general expectation of a brilliant shower in 1866.
In this country, however, the public curiosity was
much disappointed.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The numbers seen were
greater than on ordinary nights, but not such as
would have attracted any special attention. The
greatest number recorded at any one station was
seen at New Haven by Professor Newton. On the
night of the 12th 694 were counted in five hours and
twenty minutes, and on the following night, 881 in
five hours. A more brilliant display was, however,
witnessed in Europe. Meteors began to appear in
unusual frequency about 11 o'clock on the night of
the 13th, and their numbers continued to increase
with great rapidity for more than two hours; the
maximum being reached a little after 1 o'clock. A
writer in Edinburgh, Scotland, thus describes the
phenomenon as observed at that city:&mdash;"Standing
on the Calton Hill, and looking westward,&mdash;with
the observatory shutting out the lights of Princes
Street,&mdash;it was easy for the eye to delude the imagination
into fancying some distant enemy bombarding
Edinburgh Castle from long range; and
the occasional cessation of the shower for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
seconds, only to break out again with more numerous
and more brilliant drops of fire, served to countenance
this fancy. Again, turning eastward, it was
possible now and then to catch broken glimpses of
the train of one of the meteors through the grim
dark pillars of that ruin of most successful manufacture,
the National Monument; and in fact from
no point in or out of the city was it possible to
watch the strange rain of stars, pervading as it did
all points of the heavens, without pleased interest
and a kindling of the imagination, and often a
touch of deeper feeling that bordered on awe." At
London about 1 o'clock a single observer counted
200 in two minutes. The whole number seen at
Greenwich was 8485. The shower was also observed
in different countries on the continent.</p>

<p>In 1867 the display was generally observed
throughout the United States. From the able and
interesting reports of Commodore Sands and Professors
Newcomb, Harkness, and Eastman, we derive
the following facts in regard to the shower as
seen at Washington, D. C.:</p>

<p>The shower of 1868 was in some respects quite
remarkable, though the number of meteors was less
than in 1866 or 1867. At New Haven the fall commenced
about midnight, and from 2 o'clock till day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>break
over 5000 meteors were counted. The time
of maximum could not be accurately determined,
as no decrease in the numbers was observable till
dawn. The display was also witnessed in England
and in Cape Colony, South Africa. The times of
maxima in these countries differed so materially as
to indicate a decided stratification of the meteoric
stream. The entire depth, moreover, where crossed
by the earth in 1868, was much greater than at the
part traversed either in 1866 or 1867.</p>

<p>In 1869 the shower was observed at Port Sa&iuml;d,
Lower Egypt, by G. L. Tupman, Esq.; in Florida,
U. S., by Commander William Gibson, U.S.N.;
and at Santa Barbara, California, by Mr. G. Davidson
and Mrs. E. Davidson. The first observed 112
meteors in 1h. 54m., from 2h. 30m. to 4h. 24m.,
Alexandria mean time; the numbers during this
interval being nearly equal, though slightly decreasing.
Throughout the morning (November 14) the
sky was only partly clear. The two observers
at Santa Barbara saw 556 in 2h. 25m., ending at
3h. 43m. <small>A.M.</small> In Florida also the display was
quite brilliant, though inferior to that of 1868. It
should be remarked that the morning in many parts
of the United States was cloudy. No considerable
number of the meteors of this stream has been observed
in any part of the world since 1869.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Discussion of the Phenomena.</span></p>

<p>Since the memorable display of November 13,
1833, the phenomena of shooting-stars have been
observed and discussed with a very lively interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Among the first laborers in this department of research
the names of Olmsted, Herrick, and Twining
must ever hold a conspicuous place. The fact
that the position of the radiant point did not change
with the earth's rotation at once placed the cosmical
origin of the meteors wholly beyond question.
The theory of a ring of nebulous matter revolving
round the sun in an elliptic orbit&mdash;a theory somewhat
different from that proposed by Olmsted&mdash;was
found to afford a simple and satisfactory
explanation of the phenomena. This hypothesis
of an eccentric stream of meteors intersecting the
earth's orbit was adopted by Humboldt, Arago, and
others, shortly after the occurrence of the meteoric
shower of 1833.</p>

<p>A few years previous to the display of 1866 it
was shown by Professor Newton, of Yale College,
that the distribution of meteoric matter around the
ring or orbit is far from uniform; that the motion
is retrograde; that the node of the orbit has an annual
forward motion of 102&acute;&acute;.6 with respect to the
equinox, or of 52&acute;&acute;.4 with respect to the fixed stars;
that the periodic time must be limited to five
accurately determined periods, viz.: 180.05 days,
185.54 days, 354.62 days, 376.5 days, or 33.25 years;
and that the inclination of the orbit to the ecliptic
is about 17&deg;. Professor Newton, for reasons assigned,
regarded the third period named as the
most probable. He remarked, however, that by
computing the secular motion of the node for each
periodic time, and comparing the result with the
known precession, it was possible to determine
which of the five periods is the correct one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>For the application of this crucial test,&mdash;a problem
of more than ordinary interest,&mdash;we are indebted
to Professor J. C. Adams, of Cambridge,
England. By an elegant analysis it was first shown
that for either of the first four periods designated
by Professor Newton, the annual motion of the
node, resulting from planetary perturbation, would
be considerably less than one half of the observed
motion. It only remained, therefore, to examine
whether the period of 33&frac14; years would give a motion
of the node corresponding with observation.
Professor Adams found that in this time the longitude
of the node is increased 20&acute; by the action of
Jupiter, 7&acute; by the action of Saturn, and 1&acute; by that
of Uranus. The effect of the other planets is
scarcely perceptible. The <i>calculated</i> motion in 33&frac14;
years is therefore 28&acute;. The <i>observed</i> motion in the
same time, according to Professor Newton, as previously
stated, is 29&acute;. This remarkable accordance
was at once accepted by astronomers as satisfactory
evidence that the period is about 33.25 years.</p>

<p>Having determined the periodic time, the mean
distance, or semi-axis major, is found by Kepler's
third law to be 10.34. The aphelion is consequently
situated at a comparatively short distance beyond the
orbit of Uranus. The orbit is represented in Fig. 4.</p>

<p>It was stated at the close of Chapter VI. that
shooting-stars are the dissevered fragments of
cometic matter, which, penetrating our atmosphere,
are rendered luminous by the resistance so encountered.
The discovery that comets and meteors are
actually moving in the same orbits was first announced
by Signor Schiaparelli in 1867. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
coincidence of the orbits of Tempel's comet<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> as
computed by Dr. Oppolzer, and the meteors of
November 14 as determined by Schiaparelli, is
too close to be regarded as merely accidental.
These elements are as follows:</p>

<p>The fact is thus obvious that the meteors of November
14 are the products of the comet's gradual
dissolution. It has been stated that the comets of
1366 and 1866 are probably identical. The interval
indicates a period of 33.283 years&mdash;greater by 39
days than that found by Oppolzer. With this
value of the periodic time and the known secular
variation of the node it is found that the comet
and Uranus were in close proximity about the beginning
of the year 547 <small>B.C.</small> It is therefore not improbable
that the former was then thrown into its
present orbit by the attraction of the latter. The
celebrated Leverrier designated the year 126 of our
era as the probable epoch of the comet's entrance
into our system. This date, however, is incompatible
with the period here adopted. It is worthy of
remark, moreover, as bearing on this question, that
the extension of the cluster in the tenth century, as
indicated by the showers of 902, 931, and 934, was
too great to have been effected in so short a period
as 800 years.</p>

<p>With the period of 33.283 years it is easy to find
that the comet will make a near approach to the earth
about the 16th or 17th of November, 1965, and to
Uranus in 1983. At one of these epochs the cometary
orbit will probably undergo considerable transformation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen that the comet of 1866, and also
the meteoroids following in its path, have their
perihelion at the orbit of the earth, and their aphelion
at the orbit of Uranus. Both planets, therefore,
at each encounter with the current not only appropriate
a portion of the meteoric matter, but entirely
change the orbits of many meteoroids. In regard
to the devastation produced by the earth in passing
through the cluster, it is sufficient to state that, according
to Weiss, the meteor orbits resulting from
the disturbance will have all possible periods from
21 months to 390 years. It may be regarded, therefore,
as evidence of the recent<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> introduction of this
meteor-stream into the solar system that the comet
of 1866, which constitutes a part of the cluster, has
not been deflected from the meteoric orbit by either
the earth or Uranus.</p>

<small>OTHER METEORIC STREAMS.</small></h3>


<p><i>The Meteors of August</i> 7-11.&mdash;Muschenbroek, in
his "Introduction to Natural Philosophy," published
in 1762, stated as the result of his own observations
that shooting-stars are more abundant in August
than in any other part of the year. The fact, however,
that a maximum occurs on the 9th or 10th of
the month was first shown by Quetelet in 1835.
Since that time the shower has been regularly observed
both in Europe and America; the number
of meteors at the maximum sometimes amounting
to 160 per hour. Their tracks when produced backward
intersect each other at a particular point in
the constellation Perseus.</p>

<p>Of the 315 meteoric displays given in Quetelet's
catalogue, 63 belong to the August epoch. Their
dates up to the commencement of the present century
are as follows:</p>

<p>As the earth is about five days in crossing the

8,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>In 1866 Professor Schiaparelli, on computing the
orbit of this meteoric stream, noticed the remarkable

Oppolzer. These coincidences are exhibited in the

<p>It appears, therefore, that the third comet of 1862
is a part of the meteoric stream whose orbit is
crossed by the earth on the 10th of August.</p>

<p>The characteristics of different meteor-zones afford
interesting indications in regard to their relative age,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the magnitude and composition of their corpuscles,
etc. Thus, if we compare the streams of
August 10 and November 14, we shall find that
the former probably entered our system at a comparatively
remote epoch. We have seen that at each
return to perihelion the meteoric cluster is extended
over a greater arc of its orbit. Now, Tuttle's comet
and the August meteors undoubtedly constituted a
single group previous to their entering the solar
domain. It is evident, however, from the annual
return of the shower during the last 90 years, that
the ring is at present nearly if not quite continuous.
That the meteoric mass had completed many revolutions
before the ninth century of our era is manifest
from the frequent showers observed between
the years 811 and 841. At the same time, the long
interval of 83 years between the last observed display
in the ninth century, and the first in the tenth,
seems to indicate the existence of a wide chasm in
the ring no more than a thousand years since.</p>

<p>Neither the period of the meteors nor that of the
comet can yet be regarded as accurately ascertained.
The latter, however, in all probability, exceeds the
former by several years. Now, at each passage of
the earth through the elliptic stream, those meteoroids
nearest the disturbing body must be thrown
into orbits differing more or less from that of the
primitive group. In like manner the near approach
of the <i>comet</i> to the earth at an ancient epoch may
account for the lengthening of its periodic time.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">The Meteors of November 27.</p>

<p>Professor Schiaparelli's brilliant discovery of the
relation between comets and meteors may now be
ranked with the established truths of astronomy.
His hypothesis, however, in regard to the <i>origin</i> of
meteoric streams has not been generally accepted.
Comets and meteors, according to his theory, are
derived from cosmical clouds existing in great numbers
in stellar space. These nebul&aelig;, in consequence
of their own motion or that of the sun, are drawn
towards the centre of our system. By the unequal
influence of the sun's attraction on different parts,
such clouds are transformed into currents of great
length before reaching the limits of the planetary
system. Shooting-stars, fire-balls, aerolites, and
comets being all of the same nature, differing merely
in size, sometimes fall towards the sun as parts of
the same current.</p>

<p>The views of Dr. Weiss, of Vienna, differ from
those of Schiaparelli, in that he regards comets as
the original bodies by whose disintegration meteor-streams
are gradually formed.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> "Cosmical clouds,"
he remarks, "undoubtedly appear in the universe,
but only of such density that in most cases they
possess sufficient coherence to withstand the destructive
operation of the sun's attraction, not only up
to the boundaries of our solar system, but even
within it. Such cosmical clouds will always appear
to us as comets when they pass near enough to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
earth to become visible. Approaching the sun,
the comet undergoes great physical changes, which
finally affect the stability of its structure: it can no
longer hold together: parts of it take independent
orbits around the sun, having great resemblance to
the orbit of the parent comet. With periodical
comets, this process is repeated at each successive
approach to the sun. Gradually the products of
disintegration are distributed along the comet's
orbit, and if the earth's orbit cuts this, the phenomenon
of shooting-stars is produced."</p>

<p>These views of the distinguished astronomer of
Vienna are confirmed by the star-shower of November
27, 1872. That the orbits of the earth and
Biela's comet intersect at the point passed by the
former about the last of November, and that in
1845 the comet separated into two visible parts, has
been stated in a previous chapter. The comet's
non-appearance in December, 1865, and in September,
1872, was regarded by astronomers as presumptive
evidence of its progressive dissolution. A meteoric
shower, resulting from the earth's collision
with the cometary <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, was accordingly expected
about the 27th of November.</p>

<p>The first indication of the approaching display
appeared on the evening of November 24, when
meteors in unusual numbers were observed by Professor
Newton, at New Haven, Connecticut. On
Wednesday evening, the 27th, from the close of
twilight till 8 o'clock, a decided shower of shooting-stars
was noticed in various parts of the United
States. At Greencastle, Indiana, Professor Joseph
Tingley counted 110 meteors in 40 minutes, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Princeton, in the same State, Mr. D. Eckley Hunter
counted 70 in 80 minutes. The numbers seen at
New Haven were considerably greater. The fact
that the display commenced before daylight had
entirely closed seemed to indicate that only the
termination of the shower had been observed in
this country. Accordingly the display was soon
found to have been witnessed from 60&deg; E. to 90&deg; W.
of Greenwich, or through 150&deg; of longitude. In
England the first bolide of the swarm was seen by
M. M. Brinkley, at 3 o'clock, <small>P.M.</small>, in full daylight.
The meteors were most numerous in the southern
part of the continent, particularly in Italy. At the
Observatory of Breslau, according to M. Faye, 3000
were seen from 6h. 30m. to 7h. 50m. Dr. Heis reported
that at M&uuml;nster 2500 per hour were counted
by two observers. At Naples, Signor Gasparis observed
two meteors per second. At Turin, M. Denza,
Director of the Observatory, reported 33,400 in 6h.
30m.; many of various and delicate colors, and
followed by long and brilliant trains. At some
points the numbers were so great that an accurate
enumeration was wholly impossible. In short, the
display was decidedly the most brilliant that has
occurred since that of November 13, 1833.</p>

<p>But some of the most interesting circumstances
in connection with the phenomena of November
27, 1872, remain to be detailed. Astronomers without
exception regarded the display as due to the
earth's passage through the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> following in the
path of Biela's comet. In accordance with this view
Dr. Klinkerfues, of Gottingen, concluded that the
comet itself, or rather its largest portion, ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
be found in the region of the heavens nearly opposite
to that from which the meteoroids appeared to radiate.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
As this point in the southern hemisphere
could not be observed in Europe, he conceived the
happy idea of detecting the fugitive <i>by means of the
electric telegraph</i>. The following was accordingly dispatched
to Mr. Pogson, Director of the Government
Observatory at Madras, in Southern India: "<i>Biela
touched earth on 27th; search near Theta Centauri</i>." The
first two mornings after the receipt of this dispatch
were cloudy at Madras. On the third, however, the
cometary fragment was found, and its motion accurately
measured. The observer described it as
circular and rather bright, with no traces of a tail.
But one fragment could be detected. On the next
morning, December 3, the comet was again observed.
Its diameter had sensibly increased; it had a bright
nucleus, and still presented a circular aspect. A faint
tail was also noticed, equal in length to one-fourth
of the moon's apparent diameter. The following
mornings being again cloudy, no further observations
could be obtained. This cometary mass will
be in close proximity to the earth about the last of
November, 1892. Another brilliant meteoric shower
may therefore be expected at that epoch.</p>

<p>The probability that these meteors are derived
from a ring which intersects the earth's orbit, was
first suggested by Arago in 1836. A comparison of
dates led Herrick to designate 27 years as the probable
period of the cluster. In the <i>Astronomische Nachrichten</i>,
No. 1632, Dr. Weiss called attention to the
fact that the orbit of the first comet of 1861 very
nearly intersects that of the earth, in longitude
210&deg;&mdash;the point passed by the latter at the epoch
of the April meteoric shower. A relation between
the meteors and the comet, indicating an approximate
equality of periods, was thus suggested as
probable. But the comet, according to Oppolzer,
does not complete a revolution in less than 415
years. If, therefore, the meteoric period is nearly
the same, the known dates of star-showers indicate
a diffusion of meteoroids around one half of the
orbit previous to the display of the year 15 <small>B.C.</small> No
subsequent perturbation, then, of a particular <i>part</i>
could sensibly effect the general orbit of the stream.
The infrequency of the display renders, therefore,
the hypothesis of a long period extremely improbable.</p>

<p>The entire interval between 687 <small>B.C.</small> and <small>A.D.</small> 1803<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is 2490 years, or 92 periods of 27.0652 years; and

<p>With a period of 27 years, the perihelion being
interior to the earth's orbit, the aphelion distance of
the meteors would be very nearly equal to the distance
of Uranus. The next shower, if the assumed
period be correct, ought to occur about 1884. It is
worthy of remark that near the time of the last
(hypothetical) return Mr. Du Chaillu witnessed the
meteors of this epoch, in considerable numbers, in
the interior of Africa.</p>


<p class="caption">The Meteors of December 12.</p>

<p>Meteoric showers have occurred about the 12th
of December in the following years:</p>

<p>1. <small>A.D.</small> 901. "The whole hemisphere was filled
with those meteors called falling-stars from midnight
till morning, to the great surprise of the beholders
in Egypt."</p>

<p>2. In 930 a remarkable shower of falling stars
was observed in China.</p>

<p>3. Extraordinary meteoric phenomena were observed
at Zurich at the same epoch in 1571.</p>

<p>4. On the night of the 11th and 12th of December,
1833, a great number of shooting-stars were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
seen at Parma. At the maximum as many as ten
were visible at the same time.</p>

<p>5. (Doubtful.) 1861, 1862, and 1863. Maximum
probably in 1862. The meteors at this return were
far from being comparable in numbers with the ancient
displays. The shower, however, was distinctly
observed. R. P. Greg, Esq., of Manchester, England,
says the period of December 12, 1862, was
"exceedingly well defined."</p>

<p>These dates indicate a period of about 29<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></small> years.

<p>Professor Schiaparelli, in his list of meteoric
showers whose radiant points are derived from observations
made in Italy during the years 1868, 1869,
and 1870, describes one as occurring on April 30

by R. P. Greg, F.R.S., of Manchester, England.
This meteor-stream, it is now proposed to show, is
probably derived from one much more conspicuous
in ancient times.</p>

<p>The orbits and periods, except in the few cases

of the observed clusters are probably the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of
ancient comets whose aphelia were in the vicinity of
Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>THE ORIGIN OF COMETS AND METEORS.</small></h3>


<p>The fact that comets and meteors, or at least a
large proportion of such bodies, have entered the
solar system from stellar space, is now admitted by
all astronomers. The question, however, in regard
to the origin and nature of these cosmical clouds
still remains undecided. The theory that they consist
of matter expelled with great velocity from the
fixed stars appears to harmonize the greatest number
of facts, and is accordingly entitled to respectful
consideration. The evidence by which it is sustained
may be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p>1. The observations of Zollner, Respighi, and
others, have indicated the operation of stupendous
eruptive forces beneath the solar surface. The rose-colored
prominences, which Janssen and Lockyer
have shown to be masses of incandescent hydrogen,
are regarded by Professor Respighi as phenomena
of eruption. "They are the seat of movements of
which no terrestrial phenomenon can afford any
idea; masses of matter, the volume of which is
many hundred times greater than that of the earth,
completely changing their position and form in the
space of a few minutes." The nature of this
eruptive force is not understood. We may assume,
however, that it was in active operation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
long before the sun had contracted to its present
dimensions.</p>

<p>2. With an initial velocity of projection equal to
380 miles per second, the matter thrown off from
the sun would be carried beyond the limits of the
solar system, never to return. With velocities somewhat
less, it would be transported to distances corresponding
to those of the aphelia of the periodic
comets.</p>

<p>3. On the 7th of September, 1871, Professor
Young, of Dartmouth College,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> witnessed an extraordinary
explosion on the sun's surface. The observer,
with his telescope, followed the expelled
matter to an elevation of over 200,000 miles. The
mean velocity between the altitudes of 100,000 and
200,000 miles was 166 miles per second. This rate
of motion <i>in vacuo</i> would indicate an initial velocity
of about 260 miles per second. But the sun is surrounded
by an extensive atmosphere, whose resistance
must have greatly retarded the velocity of the
outrush before reaching the height of 100,000 miles.
The original velocity of these hydrogen clouds was
therefore sufficient, in all probability, to have carried
them, if unresisted, beyond the solar domain.
Solid or dense matter propelled with equal force
would doubtless have been driven off never to return.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>4. This eruptive force, whatever be its nature, is
probably common to the sun and the so-called fixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
stars. If so, the dispersed fragments of ejected
matter ought to be found in the spaces intervening
between sidereal systems. Accordingly, the phenomena
of comets and meteors have demonstrated
the existence of such matter, widely diffused, in the
portions of space through which the solar system is
moving.</p>

<p>5. According to Mr. Sorby the microscopic structure
of the aerolites he has examined points evidently
to the fact that they have been at one time
in a state of fusion from intense heat,&mdash;a fact in
striking harmony with this theory of their origin.</p>

<p>6. The velocity with which some meteoric bodies
have entered the atmosphere has been greater than
that which would have been acquired by simply
falling toward the sun from any distance, however
great. On the theory of their sidereal origin, this
excess of velocity has been dependent on the primitive
force of expulsion. The shower of aerolites
which fell at Pultusk, Poland, on the 30th of January,
1868,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> is not only a remarkable illustration of
the fact here stated, but also of another which may
be accounted for by the same theory, viz.: that
meteoric bodies sometimes enter the solar system in
groups or clusters.</p>

<p>7. A striking argument in favor of this theory
may be derived from the researches of the late Professor
Graham, considered in connection with those
of Dr. Huggins and other eminent spectroscopists.
Professor Graham found large quantities of hydrogen
confined in the pores or cavities of certain meteoric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
masses. Now, the spectroscope has shown that the
sun's rose-colored prominences consist of immense
volumes of incandescent hydrogen; that the same
element exists in great abundance in many of the
fixed stars, and even in certain nebul&aelig;; and that
the star in the Northern Crown, whose sudden outburst
in 1866 so astonished the scientific world, afforded
decided indications of its presence.</p>
